# DiabetesClassification
Utilized data from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database to try and classify whether or not someone had diabetes using Python.

Ways to improve the model:
1) input feature bucketing (create new variables for blood pressure
in a specific range, glucose levels in a specific range, etc
2) improve the data cleaning by replacing 0 values with mean value
3) Read a bit about what metrics do doctors rely on the most to 
diagnose a diabetic patient and create new features

See if accuracy can be improved achieving 85-90%
